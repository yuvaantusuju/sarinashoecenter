/**
 * We need to maintain a mapping of deployment id to worker version for skew protection.
 *
 * The mapping is used to request the correct version of the workers when Next attaches a deployment id to a request.
 *
 * The mapping is stored in a worker en var:
 *
 *   {
 *      latestDepId: "current",
 *      depIdx: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
 *      depIdy: "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy",
 *      depIdz: "zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz",
 *   }
 *
 * Note that the latest version is not known at build time as the version id only gets created on deployment.
 * This is why we use the "current" placeholder.
 *
 * When a new version is deployed:
 * - "current" is replaced with the latest version of the Worker
 * - a new entry is added for the new deployment id with the "current" version
